# [🏋️ Body Transformation](https://body-transformation-one.vercel.app/)

**Body Transformation** is a web app that lets you explore how your body might change over time based on daily habits like calories, sleep, steps, and activity. Enter your stats, adjust inputs, add per-day overrides (like a big cheat meal or poor sleep), and the app forecasts your weight, body fat, and lean mass.

Built with **React + Vite + TypeScript + TailwindCSS** and deployed on **Vercel**.
